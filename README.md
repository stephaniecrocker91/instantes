STRATEGY:
---------

* * *

Create an aesthetically pleasing, simple yet fast  open source user interface content sharing app that is easy to navigate. The site allows users to create their profile (including avatar, username and bio), and upload their own content including photos, titles and decriptions. Users can also view and interact with other users posts: liking, commenting and saving as favourites. Their favourites will all be displayed in their favourites page.


The site will allow for user authentification, and basic CRUD functionality.


The goal is to create a code that is clear and allows you to update with ease.

### WIREFRAMES:


* * * 

## THE CODE:

* * *
Prior to commencing to write my code out, I planned out the ERD.

<img src="./static/images/diagram.png" width="1000px">

You can find a link to a more in depth database Backend ReadMe HERE.

The User Model ---> Django default User Model. We will use user (PK), Email and Password.

Recipe Model --> Is our main model. It contains all the required fields for our recipe: recipe_id(PK), title, category(FK), slug, author(FK-User), created_on, image, ingredients, directions, likes, favourites, status and user. 


Categories Model --> Containing the categories_id(PK), category field.

Comments Model --> Containing, comment_id(PK), User(FK), recipe_id, body, created_on.

Favourites Model --> Contains favourtites_id, recipe_id, user, likes.


IMPORTANT RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN TABLES:
* One to many relationship between the User and the Recipe model.
* One to many relationship between the User and the Favouries model.
* One to many relationship between the User and the Comments model.
* One to many relartionships between Category and Recipe's.
* One to many relationships between Recipe and Comments model.


* * * 

## SURFACE

* * *
* When initially planning this site, I knew I wanted more of a masculine style calling for a deep, rich colour scheme. 
* This would allow for the images to really pop in the app.

* My initial wireframes...

<img src="./static/images/wireframe.png" width="500px">
<img src="./static/images/wireframe2.png" width="500px">
<img src="./static/images/wireframe7.png" width="500px">

<img src="./static/images/wireframe5.png" width="500px">
<img src="./static/images/wireframe6.png" width="500px">


* * *

### Colors

* * *

Mostly white, black, grey and a pop of green in afew buttons. Most of the color will come from the images uploaded by uses.

<img src="./static/images/color2.png" width="800px">
<img src="./static/images/color3.png" width="800px">
<img src="./static/images/color4.png" width="800px">



* * * 

### Typography

* * *

Light, spaced, masculine and clean font. 
*  Poppins
*  Use of letter-spacing
*  Use of uppercase




<img src="src/assets/poppins.png" width="500px">
<img src="src/assets/poppins-2.png" width="500px">

### Images and Icons

* * *

Use of a few font-awesome icons for:
* NavBar links
* Like, Bookmark, and comment buttons.
* Dropdown menu for editing/deleting posts
* Dropdown meny for editing profile

<img src="src/assets/navbar.png" width="500px">
<img src="src/assets/dropdown-post.png" width="500px">
<img src="src/assets/like-bookmark-comment.png" width="500px">

Default avatar profile image: which is automatically uploaded when profile is created.

<img src="src/assets/like-bookmark-comment.png" width="500px">

Vectors used for:
* Search feature: when something is not found (page, searched item, or no posts)
* Upload item

<img src="src/assets/magnifying.png" width="500px">
<img src="src/assets/upload-rm.png" width="500px">

Hexedecimal icon for the search bar.

<img src="src/assets/searchbar.png" width="500px">

A couple images for our Sign In and Sign Up pages: create the mood of the site. I purposefully picked images that go with the color scheme of the site: dark, deep, masculine colors.

    <img src="static/images/create-recipe3.png" width="800px">

    * If the user created the recipe, they can edit it. If they did not create the recipe, this option is not available. SC had a edit fontawesome icon. Teriyaki and potato sides do not! 

     <img src="static/images/create-recipe3.png" width="800">

- When clicking on the Edit icon on the recipe (that is available only if the user created this specific recipe), the user is redirected to the edit_recipe.html page. This is very similar to the create_recipe.html. In this case the fields are pre-populated. 

<img src="static/images/edit-1.png" width="800px">
<img src="static/images/edit-2.png" width="800px">

There is an extra feature = DELETE RECIPE!  It is in a bright red button, so as to warn the user of teh severity of this button's functinality.

<img src="static/images/edit-3.png" width="800px">

When changing the details and clicking Update Recipe button, the use ris redirected to the home page. The Recipe is updated!!

<img src="static/images/updated-succes.png" width="800px">


- When clicking Favourites on navbar, the user is redirected to the favourites page. This renders only the recipes that our user has favourited. They are displayed similar to the homepage. Recipes that have been favourited by other users... these will NOT be displayed.

<img src="static/images/faves-display.png" width="800px">
<img src="static/images/faves-display2.png" width="800px">


- When clicking Drafts on navbar, the user is redirected to the drafts page. This renders only the recipes written by the user, who's status is draft. They are displayed similar to the homepage. Other users drafts will NOT be displayed here. 

<img src="static/images/drafts-display.png" width="800px">
<img src="static/images/drafts-display2.png" width="800px">

* * *

DELETE

* * *

- When clicking Delete Recipe at the bottom of the edit_recipe.html, the user is redirected to the delete_recipe.html page. This is as a means of security. It asks for the user to confirm wether they are sure they want to delete this file.

<img src="static/images/delete-conf.png" width="800px">

* * *

LOG OUT

* * *

- When clicking on Logout (in our navbar), the link works correctly and re-directs us to the logout.html page. For security, this asks the user if they are sure they want to log out? If they click Logout, they are succesully redirected to the Homepage where limited features are displayed again.

<img src="static/images/logout.png" width="800px">


USER AUTHENTIFICATION PROTECTION

* * *

- Added code to ensure the correct user is logged in to access certain urls. If not verified, the following message appears


<img src="static/images/private-delete.png" width="800px">

* * * 

DJANGO ADMINISTRATOR

* * *

- From the backend, the administrator can create, edit and delete any Recipes, Comments, Categories. They can delete users. When making a change to any of these, the results are immediately visible in the front end of the site.

###### BUGS & FIXES: 


* * * 

#### Unresolved bug 

* * * 

I would like to resolve the following issue. 

* When creating recipe, the user can only select an option from a dropdown meny that has been preset. They cannot add their own category (in the case that they needed to). Currently I can only add categories froom the back end.

    * Django and gunicorn --> pip3 install 'django<4' gunicorn
    * Supporting libraries --> pip3 install dj_database_url psycopg2
    * Cloudinary libraries --> pip3 install dj3-cloudinary-storage

2. Create a requirements file --> pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt

3. Create your project: in this case for-the-love-of-food

4. Create an app using command --> python3 manage.py startapp APP_NAME

5. Add it to installed apps --> INSTALLED_APPS = [
    â¦
    'APP_NAME',
]

6. Save file and migrate changes using command --> python3 manage.py migrate

10. set environment variables --> os.environ["DATABASE_URL"] = "Paste in Heroku DATABASE_URL Link"
11. Add in a secret key --> os.environ["SECRET_KEY"] = "Make up your own randomSecretKey"


_IN HEROKU ..._


12. Add secret Key to config vars --> SECRET_KEY, ârandomSecretKeyâ


_IN GITPOD / IN SETTINGS.PY_


13. Reference env.py file -->
import os
import dj_database_url

if os.path.isfile("env.py"):
   import env

14. Remove the secret key and replace it with the following variable--> SECRET_KEY = os.environ.get('SECRET_KEY')


15. Comment out the DataBases section -->
 DATABASES = {
     'default': {
         'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
         'NAME': BASE_DIR / 'db.sqlite3',
     }
 }

 16. Add new database section -->
 DATABASES = {
   'default': dj_database_url.parse(os.environ.get("DATABASE_URL"))
}

17. In the terminal, save files and make migrations --> python3 manage.py migrate


_GETTING STATIC AND MEDIA FILES STORED ON CLOUDINARY..._


18. Create a cloudinary account, and copy the CLOUDINARY_URL from the dashboard.

19. Add url to env.py -->
os.environ["CLOUDINARY_URL"] = "cloudinary://************************"


_BACK IN HEROKU ..._


20. Paste Cloudinary URL to Heroku Config Vars -->
Add to Settings tab in Config Vars e.g. COUDINARY_URL, cloudinary://************************

21. In config vars, add DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC, 1. This will be rmeoved before final deployment.


_IN GITPOD / SETTINGS.PY_


22. Install Cloudinary libraries -->
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    â¦,
    'cloudinary_storage',
    'cloudinary',
    â¦,
]

23. Tell Django to use Cloudinary to store media and static files -->
STATIC_URL = '/static/'

STATICFILES_STORAGE = 'cloudinary_storage.storage.StaticHashedCloudinaryStorage'
STATICFILES_DIRS = [os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'static')]

web: gunicorn PROJ_NAME.wsgi

28. In terminal --> Add, Commit and Push

_IN HEROKU ..._

29. Deploy manually -->  Github as deployment method, on main branch



#### FINAL PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT..

_IN GITPOD / SETTINGS.PY_

1. Set DEBUG flag to False!! If not...
    * Django will serve the static  files such as css files itself, instead of relying on Cloudinary.
    * Django will continue to give us verbose error pages which can reveal credentials, and things you want to keeo secret. This will compromise your site!
2. Add a few more settings--> X_FRAME_OPTIONS = 'SAMEORIGIN'
    * Without this our summer note editor would no  longer work when we deploy the project. This is due to Cross-Origin Resource Sharing, which tells the browser which resources are permitted to be loaded.
3. Save, add and commit as "deployment commit", and push to github.


_IN HEROKU..._


4. In reveal config vars, remove DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC environment variable.

5. Go to deploy tab, scroll down to the end and deplopy our branch! 

6. Your app has been deployed to heroku!

### Content & Code

This project was extremely challengin for me. I used several resources to get me to the finish line, as well as the help of tutors, my mentor and fellow students at Code Institute.

* I used the "I think therefore I blog" walk through project as a starting point and template. As per this walktrhiugh projects, I created a blog like page that stored recipes. I used some snippets of code as reference, and nbuilt upon it with more features. (Such as favourites view, create recipe view, edit and delete, and drafts view).
* Oisin (tutor) in Code Institute helped me troubleshoot some issues I was having with my cloudinary images not loading onto my site. 
* Alan (tutor) in Code Institute helped me troubleshoot some issues I was having with fontawesome icons. Thanks!
* Sean (tutor) at Code Instutute helped me troubleshoot an error I was getting when connecting my urls for creating a recipe.
* Matt (a former Code Instutute student) helped me toroubleshoot an issue I was having with displaying summernotes from the front end, and my cloudinary image not updating wehen editing my form. Thank you Matt!!!
* Chris (my mentor) helped me plan out the project and supported me every step of the way.
* Codemy.com --> I followed a few tutorials to get ideas as how to create/edit/delete my recipe blog posts. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7xaESAddDQ
